# Data-Visualization-on-Heart-Disease-Dataset
In this project, our primary objective is to predict the likelihood of an individual being affected by coronary artery disease. We will achieve this by analyzing the heart disease dataset and extracting valuable insights that reveal the significance of each feature and how these features interrelate.

Key Components:
Data Insights: We will begin by thoroughly exploring the heart disease dataset, identifying patterns, and drawing meaningful conclusions that will guide the subsequent phases of our analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA is a critical step in our process, allowing us to better understand the dataset. Through visualizations and statistical analysis, we will uncover key trends, relationships, and anomalies within the data.

Feature Engineering: Based on the insights gathered during EDA, we will perform feature engineering to enhance the dataset. This involves creating new features, transforming existing ones, and selecting the most relevant attributes to improve the accuracy of our predictive model.

Model Building: Finally, we will build a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease. This model will be trained, validated, and tested to ensure its effectiveness in detecting coronary artery problems with high accuracy.
